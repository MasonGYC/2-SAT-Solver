# README

## Basic
1. `Kosaraju.py`: implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm and generation of a valid solution.
2. `parse.py` : read the cnf file and parse parameters for `Kosaraju` and `SAT2_Solver` as inputs
3. `check_validation.py`: to check whether the solutions generated by either algorithm are valid
3. `main.py`: to compare the result between Kosaraju's algorithm with the brute-force solver 
4. `base_classes` & `construct_bool_dict`: helper functions

## Bonus
1. `random_case_generator.py`: to generate random test cases, used in `main.py` to compare the solutions of `Kosaraju` and `SAT2_Solver`
2. `SAT2_Solver.py`: the brute-force 2-SAT solver
3. `test.py`: compare the performance in terms of running time for large number of test cases for Kosaraju and brute-force solvers
 

## Manual
Run `main.py`, `test.py` to visualize the results. Parameter `upper_bound` and `factor` in `test.py` can be changed to increase/decrease the number of clauses/literals and their numerial relationship.
